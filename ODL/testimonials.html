				<h3>Fruits and Vegetables Helped My Cancer</h3>
				<div>I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Lymphoma at the age of 50.  Instead of proceeding immediately to chemotherapy and radiation treatments, 
				I decided to try making and drinking organic vegetable juice every day.  Frankly it was my daughter's idea. 
				I thought she was a bit over the top, but I did it for her.  Though I was criticized and ridiculed by many 
				for my decision, at the end of the summer my doctor declared looked at my new test results, and told me that my cancer had "gone into remission."  
				Trying out organic vegetables and fruits was the best decision I ever made.  Thanks, dd.  -- LJ, Pennsylvania</div>

				<h3>Whole Foods Helped My Diabetes</h3>
				<div> I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes, and instead of beginning the regimen of medications that many people I knew were using to manage their symptoms, 
				I wanted to cure my diabetes, completely if possible.  I started an organic whole foods diet high in vegetables and fruits, with vegetable juices. 
				12 weeks later all my lab results were normal--no more diabetes!  I can't wait to share this with my friends and family.  Another great side effect--
				I lost over 40 pounds in the past 3 months, and it was easy! I also started walking most days, which helped too.  -- PP, Nevada</div>

				<h3>Organic Vegetable Juice Helped My Allergies</h3>
				<div>I'm a florist, and used to suffer from terrible allergies to some plants and grasses!  It made my job a lot harder, let's put it that way. 
				I was doing the flowers for a client's wedding last spring, and she mentioned to me that she had started drinking organic vegetable juice and cured her own 
				allergies. Figuring I didn't have much to lose, I pulled out an old juicer from my basement and made a few of the easy recipes she recommended. 
				The first few cups were yummy, carrot and apple, but hard to fit into my schedule, because mornings are terrible around our house. In a few weeks I had 
				more energy in the mornings, and making juice got easier and easier. In a few months I had no more allergies, and now my entire extended family is drinking 
				organic vegetable juice every day!  Thanks a million, guys!  -- JH, Ohio</div>

				<h3>Smoothies and Juices Gave Me Energy</h3>
				<div>I used to have chronic low energy and fatigue. I work in high tech in Silicon Valley, and figured it was just inevitable with growing older, 
				as was taking more medications to deal with certain symptoms that were arising in my health, such as joint inflammation, insomnia, and a skin rash. 
				After drinking organic fresh-squeezed juices and vegetable smoothies for the past year, I am off all of my medications and 
				in better health than I was in my 20's.  -- HL, California</div>

				<h3>Fresh Juices Helped Me Set New Fitness Records</h3>
				<div> I did years of clinical research into spontaneous recovery from chronic illness for my medical professor, and realized that a number of the patients had 
				recovered from some significant change to their dietary intake, primarily of concentrated vegetables and fruits.  Because my research led me to understand that 
				juicing can break cell walls and liberate plant nutrients of indigestible cellulose, allowing more than 70% of these nutrients to easily access the bloodstream, 
				I became curious about the effects of juicing on a healthy person.  When I first started drinking a cup of vegetable juice a day, I noticed after a few weeks that 
				dark circles under my eyes were beginning to fade for the first time in years. Numerous other health benefits arose over the next few months, including sleeping 
				fewer hours but having higher productivity, and improving my running and weightlifting records. I wouldn't go a day now without a glass of juice 
				or a superfood smoothie.  -- CN, New York</div>

				<h3>Back Pain Improves</h3>
				<div>I work in finance, and sit at my desk most days. I started to get really bad back pain, and none of the doctors’ prescriptions were helping 
				with my pain and mobility. I didn’t want to do surgery, their final resort, before trying other measures. 
				I would not have guessed that better nutrition would help my back get better--not just feel better, but actually move and work better. 
				I also tried some of their fitness best practices and my tennis game even improved. I’m thinking of joining a coaching group to help people 
				with similar issues.  --  RL, Massachusetts</div>
