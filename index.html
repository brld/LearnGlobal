						<h3>What is Learn Global</h3><br>
						<p>Learn Global is your hub for learning clubs, which you can join and design, based on your interests and schedule. Learn Global leaders have years of deep experience in creating learning clubs, and we can offer our expertise and mentoring to you. Learning clubs are based on voluntary circles of learning pioneered by Education Professor Frank Smith, and can be tailored specifically to your needs and preferences. We have a number of learning clubs currently open, and can form new ones depending on your needs and desires. Learning is better, faster, and more fun through customized learning clubs. We'd also love to hear your thoughts and suggestions. Welcome!<p>
						<h3>Club Offerings</h3><br/>
						<p>Current and recent learning clubs include Improvisation, Entrepeneurship, Novel Writing, Coding, Debate, World Music, Finance and Investing, Chemistry, Public Speaking, Physics with Feynman, Integrative Health, Fun Math, and History and Art Around the World. Any topics of interest can lead to new clubs--just let us know what you'd like.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="box2">
						<h3>Get Involved</h3><br/>
						<p>You can join one of our clubs, or let us know about a topic of interest and how we can help design a club based on your needs. Learning clubs can be local, global, or a combination of the two. Feel free to explore more about learning clubs from Frank Smith's seminal work at Harvard. You can connect your friends and family with learning clubs through conversations and social media. The more learners, the merrier!</p>
						<p></p>
						<h3>Virtual and Physical Clubs</h3><br>
						<p>Depending on what is most convenient for your schedule, you can join and design your learning clubs to be virtual, physical, or some combination of the two. Some clubs can be held primarily through Skype, Google Hangouts, Discord, Blackboard Collaborate, Zoom.us, GoToMeeting, BlueJeans, and TeamSpeak. Other clubs can meet in person, selecting consistent or varying locations of convenience for their members. Clubs can also combine the two options in any ways they choose. What remains shared, among various meeting platforms, is building a community where people can build upon learning from other meetings and members, to enrich themselves and their communities.</p>
